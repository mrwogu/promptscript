# PromptScript

**The Infrastructure-as-Code for AI Context**

_Standardize, Audit, and Deploy AI Instructions across your entire Engineering Organization._

<div class="feature-grid" markdown>

<div class="feature-card" markdown>
### :material-gavel: Enterprise Governance
Enforce non-negotiable standards globally. Define policies once, apply them everywhere (e.g., "No `any` in TS", "Use parameterized SQL Queries").
</div>

<div class="feature-card" markdown>
### :material-lock-off: Vendor Independence
Don't lock your organization's intellectual property into one tool. Write logic in PromptScript, deploy to GitHub Copilot, Claude, or Cursor.
</div>

<div class="feature-card" markdown>
### :material-file-tree: Hierarchical Inheritance
Structure instructions like code. Inherit from `@company/backend-security` or `@team/checkout-service`.
</div>

<div class="feature-card" markdown>
### :material-refresh: Managed Lifecyle
Update a central policy and propagate changes to 100+ repositories automatically. No more manual copy-pasting.
</div>

## The Business Problem: "Prompt Drift"

Modern engineering organizations face a critical challenge: **AI Context Fragmentation**.

As you scale to 50+ repositories and deploy multiple AI tools (GitHub Copilot, Claude, Cursor), maintaining coherent AI instructions becomes impossible manually.

- **The Scale Problem:** Updating a security policy across 100 microservices takes weeks of manual PRs.
- **The Model Volatility:** New models (e.g., Claude Sonnet 4 vs 3.5) require different prompting strategies.
- **The Governance Void:** Developers use local, unvetted instructions. Junior devs miss critical security context.

Result: **Inconsistent code quality, security risks, and operational chaos.**

## The Solution: PromptOps

**PromptScript turns AI context into managed infrastructure.** It treats your prompts as code—compiled, validated, and deployed.
