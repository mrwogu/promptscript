Code style:
- Strict mode enabled
- Use named exports only
- Files: kebab-case.ts
- Use vitest as test framework
- Maintain 90% code coverage

Commands:
/review - Review code for quality and best practices
/test - Write comprehensive unit tests
/docs - Generate documentation
/deploy - 

Never:
- Never use any type - use unknown with type guards
- Never use default exports - only named exports
- Never commit without tests
- Never skip error handling
